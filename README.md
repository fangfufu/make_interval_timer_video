# make_interval_timer_video
An interval timer video generator for sports and exercises

I am the one of the cycling captain of UEA Triathlon Club for the academic year of 2017-2018. I always find it hard to keep track of the set in a turbo session for some reason. This bash script generates a video which shows the current training segment, alongside with a timer. 

## Prerequisite
  * ffmpeg - It needs to have lavfi, drawtext and drawtext enabled. The default version come from Debian Stretch works fine for me.
## Example Output
  * https://youtu.be/OuPwA-sw8ZQ
